# FBLA Codign and Programming 2022 by Kylen Williams
My coding and programming project for FBLA, 2022.

## About
This is my FBLA coding and programming project for the 2022 school year. It reccomends any of 50 attractions  based on various search attribues and selection of type/style of attraction.

##  To Run
1. Yo'llu need to have an installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). 
2. To download all the code from this repository, click the green button that says "Code" near the upper right side of the screen and click "Download Zip". 
3. Open the folder, and simply run the code in your preferred IDE!

### Things to Know About the Program
The attraction info screens can be scrolled with the UP and DOWN arrow keys, but using a scroll wheel can break the program (and require it to be restarted). Otherwise, click to choose a type of attraction, and from there you can search use the search button for further specificity. Each specific attraction is also clickable for more information!

## Thank YOU!
Thank you FBLA for considering my project in the competition!
